# 100 Days of Code Challenge

Welcome to my **100 Days of Code** journey!  
This repository documents my progress as I commit to coding **every day for 100 days**, starting from basic projects and gradually moving towards advanced full-stack applications.

---

## Goals

1. Code **at least 1–2 hours daily**.
2. Push **meaningful commits** to GitHub each day.
3. Start with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript basics** and progress to:
   - DOM Manipulation
   - APIs and ES6+
   - React + Tailwind
   - Node.js + MongoDB (Fullstack)
   - Advanced topics (Auth, AI, Real-time apps, Next.js)

## Repository Structure

Each day will have its own folder:

100_Days_of_Code/
│
├── Day1/ # Portfolio Website (HTML + CSS)
├── Day2/ # Will include JS interactivity (smooth scroll, sticky navbar, etc.)
├── Day3/
...
└── Day100/


Each folder will include:
- **Source Code** (`index.html`, CSS, JS, etc.)
- **Day-specific README.md** describing the project.

## Daily Logs

I will maintain a **log of what I learned each day** here.

### Progress Log
- **Day 1:** Uploaded my developer portfolio (HTML + CSS).
- **Day 2:** (Upcoming) Add JavaScript interactivity (smooth scroll, sticky navbar, back-to-top button).
- More coming…
