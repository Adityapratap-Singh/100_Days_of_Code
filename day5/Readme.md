# Day 5 – Universal Website Layout  
Part of my **100 Days of Code Challenge**

This project builds a **common 3-part website structure** used across dashboards, streaming apps, and content-heavy sites.  
It uses **CSS Grid** to create a **clean, flexible layout** with a top navbar, sidebars, content area, and footer/player bar.

---

## 🚀 Features
- **Top Navigation Bar (60px)** – For branding and menus.  
- **Left Sidebar (300px)** – For navigation, libraries, or filters.  
- **Center Content** – The main display area (playlists, posts, documents, etc.).  
- **Right Panel (300px)** – Optional section for chat, videos, or ads.  
- **Footer / Player Bar (90px)** – For controls or extra navigation.  
- **CSS Grid-based** – Clean, scalable, and easily adjustable.  
- **Overflow Handling** – Scrollable sidebars while keeping layout intact.
