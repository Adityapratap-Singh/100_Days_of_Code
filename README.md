# 100 Days of Code - Day 2: Kairo Chrono - Luxury Watch Store

This project is a responsive e-commerce landing page for a luxury watch brand called "Kairo Chrono," focusing on a clean design and an interactive user experience. This project marks the second day of my 100 Days of Code challenge.

## Project Description

Kairo Chrono is a fictional luxury timepiece retailer. This project showcases a product collection page with a modern and elegant design. It features an interactive shopping cart system that allows users to add products, manage quantities, and view the total price. The cart's state is saved in the browser's local storage, so items remain in the cart even after the page is refreshed.

## Features

*   **Responsive Design:** The layout adapts to different screen sizes, from mobile phones to desktops.
*   **Product Showcase:** A grid layout displays the watch collection with high-quality images and details.
*   **Interactive Shopping Cart:**
    *   Add items to the cart directly from the product grid.
    *   View the cart in a modal overlay.
    *   Increase or decrease the quantity of items.
    *   Remove items from the cart.
    *   The total price is calculated automatically.
*   **Persistent Cart:** The cart's contents are saved to `localStorage`, so they are not lost when the user leaves or reloads the page.
*   **Smooth Animations:** Subtle animations on product cards and the "Add to Cart" action enhance the user experience.
*   **Modern UI/UX:** A clean, professional design with a hero section, featured products, and a detailed footer.

## Technologies Used

*   **HTML5:** For the structure and content of the web page.
*   **CSS3:** For styling, including responsive design, animations, and custom properties.
*   **JavaScript (ES6):** For all the interactive functionality, including the cart system, event handling, and DOM manipulation.
